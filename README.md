# Dinitz-Visualizer
Dinitz's (maximum flow) algorithm visualized on a website because it's one of my favorite algorithms and I want to practice my coding outside of terminal output

The tool allows users to:
- Draw directed graphs with capacities
- Set source and sink nodes
- Step through BFS level graph construction and DFS blocking flows
- Observe residual edges and flow updates visually

The implementation follows the standard Dinitz algorithm, with explicit residual graph construction and step-by-step execution exposed through a visualization layer.

Instructions are written on the [website](https://shun4midx.github.io/dinitz-visualizer) itself.
